;;; Commentary:

;;  This package provides a minor mode to automatically synchronise a local git
;;  branch with its upstream. It is intended to be used only when an individual
;;  relies on git as a mean to synchronise versioned content between machines,
;;  and should not be used in a team environment. A typical use case consists in
;;  synchronising your personal notes between machines.
