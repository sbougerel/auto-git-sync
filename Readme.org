* Overview

`auto-git-sync` provides a minor mode to automatically synchronise a local git
branch with its upstream. It is intended to be used only when an individual
relies on git as a mean to synchronise versioned content between machines, and
should not be used in a team environment. A typical use case consists in
synchronising your personal notes between machines.
